 This repository contains samples of my work.

   1.    Robot_tactile_sensors_v7.ino is the raw code used to conduct experiments for my thesis. It is coded in C++ and is written to be used on an Arduino Uno
   2.    BLENDER-FILES contains links to two of my blender files uploaded to Google Drive. They are currently .blend files and cannot be viewed outside of Blender
   3.    'Head and Bust for Portfolio' contains a link the first of the two .blend files described, converted to a viewable .stl file
   4.    'Lyric Model for Portfolio' contains a link to the second .blend file converted to .stl
   
  
 Thank you for your time and consideration. If you would like me to include any other work please let me know
