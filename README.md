 This repository contains samples of my work.

   3.    BLENDER-FILES contains links to two of my blender files uploaded to Google Drive. They are currently .blend files and cannot be viewed outside of Blender
   4.    ______________ is the first of the two .blend files described, converted to a viewable .stl file
   5.    ______________ is the second .blend file converted to .stl
