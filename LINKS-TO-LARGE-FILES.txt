// I am self-taught at Blender, which I use to improve my understanding of objects in 3D space, 
// as well as other topics which catch my interest, such as anatomy and design

	// This is a 3D printer-ready file, with slightly less detail but complete body, clothes, hair and items
		// https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IT7DIxZLfRo9vckYBJWePxvpRlEgWxYX/view?usp=sharing
